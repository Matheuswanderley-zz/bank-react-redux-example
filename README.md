# Start with react and redux without boilerplate

## To run the project

```
npm start
```

## idea behind this project

```
the idea  is simplify the understanding of react with redux, the flow of data inside of a project even smaller than that one
```

## i know createStore is deprecated but for beginner understanding of redux in react i use createStore.

```
if u want to add some new things just send a PR into the project
```
